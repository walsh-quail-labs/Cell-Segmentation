# Cell-Segmentation

The cell segmentation framework presented here is just for the review purpose. 


## Requirements
To be able to run the cell segmentation framework, one needs the following:

* [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
* [Matlab Computer Vision Toolbox ](https://www.mathworks.com/products/computer-vision.html)
* [Matlab Image Processing Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/image.html)
* [Python 3.7.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-379/)


## Usage
As our system is a hybrid model, you need to first create a python virtual environment (our working version of python is 3.7.9) where you can install all the required packages. Let us imagine you are using conda platform to create your virtual environment. These are the steps you need to follow.
